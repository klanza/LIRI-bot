# LIRI-bot

Command line version of a speech recognition application, similar to Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the root project folder. Run the command 'npm install' in order to install the requisite node packages for the program. There is a file named 'SlamAzonSchema.sql' that will create the database required to run the application, and includes some seed data for manipulation. In order to run the actual application after installing the dependencies, run the command 'node liri.js' in your terminal.
